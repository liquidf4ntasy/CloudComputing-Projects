CSE 6331 - Fall 17
Assignment 1 - Two-Step Matrix Multiplication using Hadoop MapReduce
Name: Satyajit Deshmukh
UTA ID: 100141772

I have included multiply.distr.run & multiply.local.run files as i have changed some values in them,
according to my program Multiply.java

part-r-00000 has output of M-matrix-large.txt x N-matrix-large.txt 
multiply.distr.out has the same result.


multiply.local.run & multiply.local.out has output of M-matrix-small.txt x N-matrix-small.txt 
as the large jobs were scheduled to run today but haven't yet.


But everything works fine!

Local.run can be run later as well when the comet cluster is free.
